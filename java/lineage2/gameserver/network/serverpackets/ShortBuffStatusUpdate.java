	 * structure cddd
	 * <p/>
	 * NOTES: 1). hex converting: Skill 1229 is in hex 4CD, but in packet it is CD 04 00 00. So i think that we must read the skill's hex id form behind ^^ 2). multipe skills on row 2: i don't know what more skills can go at row2 @ offie. please contact me to test it. Currently packet is working for
	 * one skill. 3). Removing buff icon must be sended empty packet F4 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 to remove buff icon. Or it will be lasted forever.
