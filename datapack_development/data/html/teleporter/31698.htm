Ville portuaire de Rune is very different from other villages of Elmore. For one thing, it is quite a bit larger than other villages. In fact, it's so huge that the structure of Village itself is divided into upper and lower levels! Therefore, people within Village have access to other parts of Village through the gate of time and space.<br>
Now, would you like to visit the town's library?<br>
