My current headache involves something like that. Alligators on this Island were exposed to something that should never have got out of our control.<br>
If we don't do anything about them, not only will people on the mainland find out about the experiment, but they might escape our control and start breeding with normal animals. Can i count on you for a little "damage control?"<br>
