Well... your pet will be a wolf, want to tell you about him?<br>
I will try to elaborate on their breeding. During the breeding season of wolves - usually <font color="LEVEL">1-2 months</font>, pregnancy - <font color="LEVEL">60 - 62</font> days, about 3-6 pups are born, the most big - 10 they arrange their spot so they are safe. In between rocks or on the river bank, in a cave, etc. And, oddly enough, the wolves are omnivorous. They feed the calves, goats. Eat as carrion, fruits and berries. They can live without food for 5-6 days, but without water they will not stand for a long time. Come on! Now you have learned something about the pet-wolf, go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font> to <font color="LEVEL">Pet Manager Lundy</font>.
