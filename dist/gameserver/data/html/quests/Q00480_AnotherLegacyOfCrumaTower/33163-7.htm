Linkes:

<font color="LEVEL"> Martes </ font> - a monster of a tower with relics, which must find our Krasis. We have already destroyed many of the inhabitants of the towers, but found nothing of any value. We've been desperate to... but then found out about the existence of Martesa. It seems that it is more important figure than just a guard tower Cruma. That's why he keeps a particularly valuable relics, and so protected. Among other things, it must have incredible power. You should act consistently and quickly to destroy the monster and bring me <font color="LEVEL">core Martesa </ font>. I think to remove it is not difficult. When you get the kernel, then use it to be able to come back. Eventually, with You will be part of the body Martesa and you will have the ability to manage the space, as well as himself. I think because of that his gift Martes could hide from us in the Tower of Cruma. Do not worry;
this does not affect your health. At least I hope so... Is this: how dobudete core, bring it here with all haste.
