Liey:

Apparently, the memory you have not, just ask again. No, I repeat, of course. Krasis - a group of Dark Elves, decisive people's problems. Our clients - notable political figures, aristocrats... Therefore, you should not be the case before us. Since our tribe came to light, we prefer to stay in the shade. But now Shilen provokes great crisis in the world, and we can not hide anymore. Here we have revealed themselves to the world.
