Linkes:

So, I explain to you the task. I'll give you <font color="LEVEL">device for searching of treasure </ font>, with which you have to find <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious Mechanisms </ font>. Then you should move to the upper floor of the Tower of Cruma. If you kill <font color="LEVEL">Martesa </ font> and it will extract from the The core of the body <font color="LEVEL">Martesa </ font>, you can come back. Why? .. Do not you understand? It seemed to me that there is no need for a long explanation... Anything you do not understand? If so, do not hesitate to ask.
