<html><body>Elder Hierarch Fairy Noeti Mimilead:<br>
Destroy <font color="LEVEL">Cocoons </ font> and <font color="LEVEL">Huge Cocoons </ font> in the Colonies Fay. Of course, the destruction of cocoons will not give us much - the fairies no longer be the same again, and the trees will be new cocoons.<br>
But we can not sit idly by. We will work tirelessly with the cocoons, and sooner or later, our troubles will pass. </body></html>
