Warrior's Grave:

You have successfully completed the memorial service by singing the <font color="LEVEL">Warrior's Song</font> correctly. Suddenly, you hear an answering echo of the song all around you. Almost delicately, a small cloud of dust rises from the grave. The cloud coalesces in mid-air, then moves toward you and gently settles in your pocket.
