Shilen's Stone Statue:

<font color="LEVEL">The eldest daughter of Einhasad and Gran Kain</font> is inquiring about you. You stem from the Lizardman race, but you are now a part of the Elroki tribe that was born from the energy of water and prospered under the protection of the water goddess Shilen. Is this true?
