<html><body>Hierarch Asterios:<br>
It all started after <font color="LEVEL">bloody rain</font>. If you come here, you must have heard the name <font color="LEVEL">Shilen</font>?<br>
I heard a heavenly light, securing Magmeld, and came here in search of a means to save the Tree of Life. But then came alive Awakened Ruler Bede <font color="LEVEL">Agael</font>, and all struck <font color="LEVEL">corrupting the Darkness</font>.<br>
But I have still some hope.<br1>
You help me? Perhaps healed Tree of Life, we can stop the darkness, absorbing the world.<br>
