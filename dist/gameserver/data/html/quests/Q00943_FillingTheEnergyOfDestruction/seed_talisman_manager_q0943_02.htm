	<br>
The Seed Talisman, it cannot be enhanced with just any magic. <br1>Because the Talisman's core is so twisted and layered, it can only be fed by something with similar twists. &nbsp;You must seek the <font color="LEVEL">Core of Twisted Magic</font>. If you bring me this, yes, I can purify it into usable form. Yes?
