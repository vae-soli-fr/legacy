Once you have killed a creatures you need to gather their ash as soon as possible as Priest Ross requires *30 Blazing Swamp Ash* as proof you have cleared some of the monsters in the Blazing Swamp. Once you have them return them to *Priest Ross in Aden`s Einhasad Temple*. He`ll then pay you for your work. <br>
Any questions?
