Finally, in the Seeds of Evil were observed spatial fluctuations. And I have a vague idea of Ξ²β‚¬β€ΉΞ²β‚¬β€Ήhow it all began. Seeds of Destruction will return to the world of instincts and primitivism, when he wakes up their true master. The essence of it is not yet known to us. If all goes still, we lose all hope. Isthina... Necessarily have to destroy the monster that controls the Seed of Annihilation..<br>
