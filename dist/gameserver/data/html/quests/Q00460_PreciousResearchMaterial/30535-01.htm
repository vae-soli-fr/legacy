Really? Amer gave this thing before he died?<br>
He was a good friend... Even breaking promises to go easy on this earth... This man is worthy of glory. Our <font color="LEVEL">Gray Column Guild</font> forever remember the name of Amer, kept his promise!<br>
Of course, we will reward you for your help. Here, take this. This is his portion, and a little more in gratitude. Take it.
