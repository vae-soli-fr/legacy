Priest Cerenas:

Yes,and the woman's face was not clear to you?

Hmm.It is not my place to interpret your future. That is your task. But you do not have to toll alone at this.Shilen's rebirth has brought forth "the One Who Eats Prophecies"

It carries the <font color="FFFF00">Novella Prophecy.</font> If you defeat it and bring that item to me.I can help you see into the shadows of your future.
