Every day from 5:00PM to 12:00PM, on every hour, and half past every hour, you will receive an invitation to the Ceremony of Chaos.<br>
Go to wherever the invitation draws you, and if you show your abilities, you will receive a great power. Accept my invitation and I will also give you a small gift.<br>
So... what do you say?<br>
