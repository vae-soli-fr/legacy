The Messenger of God Tipiya:

It is not a coincidence. We have long been waiting for... We are waiting for a hero who will break this vicious circle and bring peace... A hero like you. Let the heroes who have been resurrected with dark magic and turned into monsters, will rest in peace. The case is a noble, because if you kill them, the souls of heroes will gain freedom.
