The Messenger of God Tipiya:

For this we need to destroy their leader. Destroy-Bound Ancients and Heroes run into a leader. In the group of 10 monsters. What kind of monster will last impossible to know in advance. But whoever it was, kill them all. This task must be repeated 2 times, then it will be possible to change the location. Of course, you can count on a corresponding reward. Time to decide. Do you accept this fate?
