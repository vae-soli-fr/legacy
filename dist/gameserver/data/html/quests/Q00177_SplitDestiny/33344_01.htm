Giant's Minion Hadel:

You got the strength of the Giants, this is awesome! But you still do not understand why you became its owner. Do you know what *Increase Strength* is? The subject retains its basic skills, once acquired. If the change is seen as a revival or development, the increase in strength can be considered subject to obtaining the Giant strength. We - spicules where created by giants. As a sign of respect your strengths... I will increase the strength of your subclass to demonstrate your capabilities.
