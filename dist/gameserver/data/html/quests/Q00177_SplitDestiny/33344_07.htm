Giant's Minion Hadel:

Obviously, the legs of Hermuncus are also fragmented. Dirty monsters could not destroy them at all... I am very worried about it. Go to the *Isle of Prayer* and retrieve the parts of Hermuncus' feet. They can be found at *Island Guardian*, *White Sand Mirage*, *Muddy Coral* and *Crinaeae*.
