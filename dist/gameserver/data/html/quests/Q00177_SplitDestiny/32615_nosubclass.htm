Ishuma:

What? I don't have any mission for you!. Oh!, I think Hadel had one that involves me, but I don't know so much by them. It's better to go to talk with them to go on a new adventure.

*(This quest start with Giant's Servant Hadel, and the quest is open only to the characters in a state of level 80 subclass with 3rd transfer quest completed and had awakened main class.)*
