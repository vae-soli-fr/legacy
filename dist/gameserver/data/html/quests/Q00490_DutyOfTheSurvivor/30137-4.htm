Grocer Vollodos:

We with a few surviving Dark Elves are now developing medicines. But I'm not a scientist and not a magician, so little I can do... All I can - extract needed for research materials, killing monsters living nearby. My own strength is not enough to fight monsters, so I address help from strangers passing by.
