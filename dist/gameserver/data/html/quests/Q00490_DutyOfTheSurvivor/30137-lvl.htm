Grocer Vollodos:

The epidemic has covered the entire continent. See! You see the dark fog, which covered all around?
If you roam around, you can get sick and die. Because of the special circumstances I can not leave this place, so I can not point you to the road. I hope you manage to get to a safe place. (This quest is available after reaching level 85.)
