Grocer Vollodos:

Have you ever been in the Village of the Dark Elves?

Ah... I was so worried about it. Because of the awakening Shilen many of my countrymen have been killed, and those who survived were forced to flee from the village. It is said that the epidemic has covered the entire continent. See! You see the dark fog, which covered all around? I think that soon we will all come to an end.
