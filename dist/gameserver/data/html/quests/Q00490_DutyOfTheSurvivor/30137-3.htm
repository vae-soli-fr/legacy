Grocer Vollodos:

The problem lies not in the fact that everyone is trying to escape to a safe place, such as Talking Island. They say many can not find a place to save and die of strange diseases. In this area, too many such accidents. Death will be more and more if we do not will take anything. The survivors need to help others. Can you help me?
