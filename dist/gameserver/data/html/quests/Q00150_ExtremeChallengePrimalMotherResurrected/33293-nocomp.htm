The officer Limier:

If you have not fought the Isthina, you will be very difficult to overcome the resurrected demon in fact it has become even stronger. We'll think about that when you gain more experience. (This quest is only available after the quest <font color="LEVEL">Isthina is Mother of Decline </ font>.)
