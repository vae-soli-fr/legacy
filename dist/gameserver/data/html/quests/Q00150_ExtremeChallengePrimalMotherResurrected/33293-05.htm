I have heard of such cases before. For example, a case when appearing on the continent of Aden Snow Queen Freya was also defeated, but then resurrected and her strength increased. Same for Istina. In any case, no matter how foolish this may appear to act it is necessary to challenge it, but it can only make you with their brave comrades. I can turn to you to destroy the revitalized Isthina?<br>
