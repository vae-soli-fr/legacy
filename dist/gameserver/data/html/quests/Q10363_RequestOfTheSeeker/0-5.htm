Nagel:
<br>
Thank you!
<br>
The pain will hopefully start to subside now... hopefully. <br>
Listen, I have one more favor to ask. The other rangers all knew I was suffering the most, and were all looking out for me, *Celin* especially. <br>
Could you tell Celin what's happened?I'd appreciate it... <br>
