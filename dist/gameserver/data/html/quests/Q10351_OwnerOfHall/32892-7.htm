The Messenger of God Tipiya:

All right. In his heart he wants to fall from the hand of a hero who will drive a sword of light and darkness at last bring peace to these places. Maybe because he can redeem himself in front of friends, whom he had once betrayed him. It turns out that his soul may be saved only by killing him. I think you will have enough forces out to battle Octavis. However, your intention is as noble, as it is dangerous. I will pray for your victory and for your safe return. Whatever the Your choice, you are sure will find the truth in the end.
