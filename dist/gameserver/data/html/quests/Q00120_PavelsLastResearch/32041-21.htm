Collector Yumi:

Yes, that must be right! The north wing was a coded version of Atlanta's name, so the east wing should be a coded version of Wendy's. I think we can now open the terminal in the east wing. According to all that I have heard, there is great danger afoot there. Oh, and if you wouldn't mind, I'd like my key back, please.
