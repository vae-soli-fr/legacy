Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:


I was looking for information about it in the book, that we have found in the Library of Runes. And here I found the following inscription: "When will bypass around the monastery, and there will be a path leading to the library, you can find a special device, which moves to the cell of the prioress."

We have to find the device. We can go to Monastery of Silence right now. I think you will figure everything out easily. I'll follow you.
