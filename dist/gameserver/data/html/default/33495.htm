Mysterious Dye Merchant Jyamis:

Hey you, adventurer! Yes, I mean you. Perhaps are you looking for good quality dyes that can be used to dye symbols? I have plenty. The only catch is, <font color="LEVEL">if you purchase one, it will be randomly chosen from my selection.</font>

I have plain dyes and rare dyes, but I can guarantee that it will be of high quality. What do you say?
