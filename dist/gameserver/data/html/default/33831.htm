Cacteon:

Have you heard of the *Orc Supervia*?

When our orc kingdom collapsed, they fought against the *Noble Orcs*. Currently, they don't belong to the orc coalition and work independently.

Their anti-orc behavior is troubling.

Worse, they have uniflied various other tribes into their anti-*Noble Orc* agenda. They're now powerful than any other individual tribe.

I'm certain they're plotting something.
