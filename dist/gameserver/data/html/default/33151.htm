Rumiese:

Are you really ready, physically and mentally? Do not underestimate Istina's power, especially here on her home turf.

If you still believe you have a chance, we will help you by weaking Istina with the magical power Ballista.

Istina's creative power is generated by the soul stone in her body. Regular attack won't even scratch the soul stone, but by concentrating your magical power into a huge attack with the Ballista, we can damage her. Also, do you have the *Energy Controller*? You will need it for this fight. I will give you more details once you are inside the cavern. Are you ready to enter now?
