In this world every thing you can do something with. You do not agree with that? Sometimes we have no idea what store ... I'm right? Now we just need to rebuild the ruined territory. Previously, it was the usual knick-knacks, and now their day and the fire could not be found, because they are the building blocks. If you bring me unwanted trophies, I exchange them for the Treasure Chest. Maybe it is useful to you. Of course, you will have to pay some commission ...<br>
Ask what trophies? Examine your inventory. Maybe it got lost anything. You're probably picking up items such as animal skins, trunks, Charcoal, Varnish or rope?<br>
