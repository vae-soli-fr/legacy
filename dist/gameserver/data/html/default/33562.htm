<html><body>Dimension Keeper Hermuncus' Minion<br>

You look surprised. I'm a 2nd-generation Spicula, awakened by the voice of the Giant's. Since I'm trying to resurrect them, I use my power to help Spiculas travel in search for the Giant's bodies. what is my power, you say? Well, I can twist and warp dimensions to allow for instant teleportation. Useful, huh?<br>
Since the *Awakened*, have access to high-level Runes, I can offer this service to you for a small fee if you are of the Awakened. The fees go toward the enormous sum of gold needed to restore my master's body, so rest assured that I'm not being greedy. Do you want to give it a try?<br>
