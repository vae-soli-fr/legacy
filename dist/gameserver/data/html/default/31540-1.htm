Valakas Watchman Klein:

The Hall of Flames leads to Valakas, the fiery dragon. It is guarded by the guard Valakas'a! If you go through them, you will be able to see Valakas'a. To prevent people from entering in this dangerous place, I'm not allowed inside just so...

After what you have learned, still want to get into the Hall of Flames? Bring me a Floating Stone! Remember, it can be used only once.
