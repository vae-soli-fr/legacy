Rumiese:

For quite some time, we've been wondering how to counter Istina's mysterious Spirit Energy.
We've found a device that can exert some slight control over the Spirit Energy. Istina will summon the *Sealing Energy*, and that will bind one target.
When that happens, you can use the *Energy Controller* to unbind the target. However, the Energy Controller will need some time to recharge after each use, so be sure to save if for when your need is great.

Also, when Istina goes into her frenzy, the power of one person alone will not stop her; you'll need at least five people using the Energy Controller at that point.
