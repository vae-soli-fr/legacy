Mentor Guide:

A mentor can guide up to 3 mentees at a time. Every time a mentee levels up, the mentor receives an item called Mentee's Mark in the mail. This mark can be exchanged for items useful after awakening. <br1>
Between levels 1 and 50, the mentor receive mail every 10 levels. After level 50, the mentor receives mail each time a mentee levels up. Be sure to delete unnecessary mail, as you cannot receive new mail if your mailbox is full. When a mentor and mentee are both online, they can receive a powerful ability-raising buff. The mentee can also receive XP and SP bonus buffs at this time. Awakening while having a mentor is called graduating. On graduating, a mentee receives a Mentee Certificate in the mail. Bring me the Mentee Certificate to receive a Diploma. Diplomas are good for various items.
